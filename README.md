# GitHub for Dustin R. Callaway

Check out my latest project at [https://www.mailboss.org](https://www.mailboss.org). It allows you to create and manage recurring emails from any mail client.

And in keeping with the "Boss" theme, I recently released an open source tab manager for Chrome called Tab Boss. Check it out here: [https://github.com/drcallaway/tab-boss](https://github.com/drcallaway/tab-boss)
